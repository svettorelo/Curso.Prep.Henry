    <h4>Why am I studying in Henry?</h4>
    <p>I was feeling stucked in my postdoctoral research and with lack of
        motivation, in part due to the pandemic situation. I felt like I
        needed to make a change, but I wasn't sure what direction to take.</p>
    <p>I always liked programming, I learnt a little bit during my grade career
        and also during my PhD. One day, out of nowhere, my dad sent me a web
        article about Henry. After making some research I found out that a friend
        of mine was already taking classes in Henry. He helped me to clear all
        my doubts and take this decision.</p>
    <p>One of the things that I liked the most about taking this road was the
        possibility to use my skills to solve particular problems, to help people.
        The fact of working with specific goals and in a group is one of the things
        that I like the most. Oh, and I also liked the short duration of the course
        and the possibility of paying for it once you have a job, I'm very thankful
        for that.</p>
    <p>I want to give my best and learn as much as I can in Henry. I'm very excited
        about moving out of my comfort zone and taking this challenge.</p>
